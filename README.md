NGINX and CFML Apps
===================

This repository contains many different NGINX configuration samples for doing the following:
+ Configuring access, error, and upstream logging
+ Setting up virtual hosts
+ Setting up SSL
+ URL Rewriting
+ Securing paths
+ Caching static files

Use the script ./bin/nginx.sh to switch between configurations and restart the NGINX master and worker processes.
